Polipo README -*-text-*-
*************

Polipo is single-threaded, non blocking caching web proxy that has
very modest resource needs.  See the file INSTALL for installation
instructions.  See the texinfo manual (available as HTML after
installation) for more information.

Current information about Polipo can be found on the Polipo web page,

    http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/

This is a patched version of polipo, not the original one.
If you have question about this specific repository, please ask me (Caeies) not Juliusz.

I'm reading the polipo-users list too.
